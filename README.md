# Project 0

I created a website that has four different .html pages (About Me, Courses I Teach, CS Resources, and CS Certification) and it is possible to access any page on my website from any other page by following the hyperlinks. My website includes both an ordered and unordered list, one table, and one image.
My website has a stylesheet file that includes five different CSS properties and five different types of CSS selectors. I use the #id selector and the .class selector once. My stylesheet includes one mobile-responsive @media query to adjust for smaller screens.
I use Bootstrap 4 on my website utilizing one Bootstrap component and two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using the Bootstrapâ€™s grid model. My stylesheets use one SCSS variable, an example of SCSS nesting, and one use of SCSS inheritance.
